## Migration from Lovable

This project has been migrated from Lovable to GitHub Pages. The following changes were made:

- Updated Vite configuration for GitHub Pages base path
- Changed from BrowserRouter to HashRouter for better GitHub Pages compatibility
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment
- Added 404.html and SPA routing scripts for proper navigation

Absolutely! Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to **build and deploy your Vite React site to the root of your GitHub Pages**:

---

## 1. Build Your Project

Open your terminal in your project directory and run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This will generate a `dist/` folder containing your production-ready site.

---

## 2. Deploy to GitHub Pages

You already have the `gh-pages` package installed and a deploy script in your `package.json`:

```json
<code_block_to_apply_changes_from>
```

To deploy, simply run:

```sh
npm run deploy
```

This will:

- Build your project (again, just to be sure)
- Push the contents of `dist/` to the `gh-pages` branch of your repository

---

## 3. Configure GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click **Settings** > **Pages** in the sidebar.
3. Under **Source**, select:
   - **Branch:** `gh-pages`
   - **Folder:** `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save**.

---

## 4. Wait for Deployment

- It may take a minute or two for GitHub Pages to update.
- Visit: [https://fiazmushfeq.github.io/](https://fiazmushfeq.github.io/)

---

## 5. (Optional) Clean Up

- If you previously had a `404.html` or `CNAME` file for a subfolder, you can remove or update them as needed.
